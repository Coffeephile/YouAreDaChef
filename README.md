What and Why
---

This library adds 'before,' 'after,' and 'around' method combinations to backbone and coffeescript projects, in much the same style as the Common Lisp Object System or Ruby on Rails controllers. With method combinations, you can easily separate concerns and make inheritance cleaner.

Yes.
